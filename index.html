      <div class = "container col-lg-2 col-md-2 col-sm-2">
        <section>

          It's working accoriding to the assignment statement but not according to my css file. <br> <br>
          Desktop view : 1102px working like 992px  and 
          Tablet view  : 853px working like 768px
        </section>
      </div>

      <div class = "container col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3">
        <section>
          <p id="p3">Three</p>
          <br><br>
          Contradiction at 1102px which is common in both tablet and desktop version! If i lower it 1101px for tablet version, it's not working right!
          what is the reason behind? <br> Please leave a comment!
